      <p>My name is Nick. I am a Software Engineer/Developer currently located in Texas. My coding journey started in 2018 through self-learning with
      YouTube and Codecademy. In 2019 I attended Thinkful's Full Stack Flex coding bootcamp. In 2021 I decided to return to school and graduated with an 
      associate of arts in Computer Science from Trinity Valley Community College. After completing my associate degree, 
      I transferred to Florida International University to pursue my bachlelor of arts in Computer Science. I am currently a Junior at FIU and plan on 
      graduating in the Summer of 2024. I am currently open to new opportunities.</p>
