      <h5>Software Engineer | Developer</h5>

      <p>Hello, I'm Nick, a dedicated Software Engineer based in Texas. My fascination with coding ignited in 2018, sparked by self-study initiatives on platforms such as YouTube and Codecademy. Keen to further enhance my skillset, I enrolled in Thinkful's Full Stack Flex coding bootcamp in 2019.</p>

      <p>In 2021, my commitment to professional growth led me back to the academic world, where I earned an Associate of Arts in Computer Science from Trinity Valley Community College. Presently, I'm broadening my knowledge base at Florida International University, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. As a Junior, I'm enthusiastically anticipating my graduation in the summer of 2024.</p>
      
      <p>With an insatiable curiosity for learning and a passion for problem-solving, I am actively exploring new opportunities to apply and expand my technical abilities.</p>
      
      <p>Feel free to reach out if you believe we could create something impactful together.</p>
